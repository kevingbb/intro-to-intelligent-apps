    "# 01 - Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT models process text using *tokens*, which are common sequences of characters found in text. The models understand the statistical relationships between these tokens, and excel at producing the next token in a sequence of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion of a prompt into tokens happens automatically when you submit a prompt so you don't need to do anything yourself. However,OpenAI services like Azure OpenAI use the number of tokens processed as part of the pricing model, in the case of Azure OpenAI, charging per 1,000 tokens. So understanding how many tokens your prompts consume is an important part of planning and building any application that will use OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt **\"Hello world, this is fun!\"** gets tokenized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello\n",
    " world,\n",
    " this\n",
    " is\n",
    " fun\n",
    "!\n",
    "\n",
    "(6 tokens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice how spaces and punctuation are included as part of the tokens. A token doesn't always necessarily equate to a single word or phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try the prompt **\"Example using words like indivisible and emojis\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example\n",
    " using\n",
    " words\n",
    " like\n",
    " ind\n",
    "iv\n",
    "isible\n",
    " and\n",
    " em\n",
    "oj\n",
    "is\n",
    "\n",
    "(11 tokens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This time you can see that some of the words, **indivisible** and **emojis**, got broken up into smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A helpful rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to ~4 characters of text for common English text. This translates to roughly Â¾ of a word (so 100 tokens ~= 75 words).\n",
    "\n",

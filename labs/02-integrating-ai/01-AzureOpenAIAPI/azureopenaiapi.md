# Working with the Azure OpenAI API directly.

In this lab, we'll walk through showing how to interact with an Azure OpenAI API service endpoint. This will not likely be the best option for most scenarios, but it highlights what a direct call to the underlying rest-based API looks like and will give you an appreciation of what's going on behind the scenes when you use the orchestrators in the other exercises.

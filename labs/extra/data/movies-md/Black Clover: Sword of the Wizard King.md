Extremely good, felt like the show was back, except with some of the best animation Iâ€™ve seen in an anime. Choreography went crazy, hype moments made you hyped, and it gave every character their time to shine, just like the main show (except my girl Dorothy ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ please she needs more screen time please)

Will very easily watch again, weâ€™ll see if rating goes up or down on rewatch.

Also, Iâ€™m the one who made most of the edits for the letterboxd page for this movie so Iâ€™m proud of that ðŸ˜Ž

Overall, 9/10, but that's coming from someone who loves the seriesas well.

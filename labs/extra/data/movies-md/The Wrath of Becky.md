_The Wrath of Becky_ continues a solid trend of practical special effect kills, but still tends to be lacking in every other aspect. The sequel isnâ€™t as funny as the filmmakers are wanting it to be and the villains are becoming forgettable cannon fodder that are nothing more than meat bags filled with a fun, red juice Becky is going to paint the walls with. Perhaps most incriminating of all is that _The Wrath of Becky_ and the _Becky_ films as a franchise has a ton of potential that the films simply have yet to tap into.

I have not objection to the occasional campy, horror flick but this felt like bad satire of bad satire (if that makes sense). Abrasive, woke cretin Becky, is a super duper fem action hero. She's such a hero she unnecessarily provokes bad guys, leading to her elderly care giver being killed and her dog beaten and abducted. 

Unsurprisingly, Becky comes for her dog and revenge. Revenge that' hardly imaginative or even overly convincing, on any level. In short, its low brow stuff, that's only alleviated by Sean William Scott's at times drily amusing performance, as lead baddie. 

Sadly, that's nowhere near enough to make up for the painfully bad script generally ghastly, characterisations and brain dead violence. 

In summary, basic in most regards. I suspect it might appeal to a marginal demographic, of resentful teenage girls, with low expectations entertainment wise, but beyond that.....??

"Fast X surprisingly pulls me back into a saga I had practically given up on. Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.

Considering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.

It's clearly the first film in a final trilogy. Interpret this last sentence as you wish."

A vacous and imbecile action potboiler which does what it's meant to do, "Entertain".

Fast X is a noisy actioner which pushes the limits of inventive action set pieces but this time stays grounded compared to the space shit they tried last time. As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. 

The cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.

Overall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.

Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how "Dom" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of "Dante" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the "family" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from "Cipher" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of "Tej" (Ludacris) and "Roman" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.

The very definition of moronic. 

Loud, obnoxious, cheesy characterisations, idiotic back story  and enough bling to make you wince.  

The only vaguely redeeming quality is the polish and money spent on the over the top, at times novel, action scenes but that's not really saying much, in the wider context of awfulness, this represents.

I'm not sure who the demographic for this flick is? I would have thought people were more evolved, as a species but well.....

In summary, just dumb, that's really all needs be said.....

I can always rely on this franchise to give me what I desire from it.

<em>'Fast X'</em> is a great time. I adore the whole series and have done so since watching the opening entry of it as a teen, sure it has changed tremendously since those halcyonic days of 2001 (OK, I was like 5 then...) but my fondness and enjoyment of these films remains unchanged - quality entertainment!

I love the main cast, particularly those we've had since the beginning or thereabouts - from Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris (I'm gonna need a spin-off with those two if you're reading, Universal!) to Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster (want more of the latter, but I get it's tricky with the absence of Paul Walker; who is still missed). I'll never tire (tyre?) of watching them together.

Away from those guys, the recurrence of the likes of Charlize Theron, John Cena and Nathalie Emmanuel is pleasant and the additions of Brie Larson and Jason Momoa are highly welcomed. I wasn't sure if Momoa was a bit too over the top in parts, but all in all he makes for a memorable antagonist - he certainly commits to the role!

The action continues to be absolutely bonkers and I continue to be absolutely onboard with everything and anything that is portrayed onscreen. The look of the film, the sound of the film... I dig it all to be honest. It's loud as heck, but that's exactly what I'd want from a <em>'Fast & Furious'</em> flick. A film worth the admission fee, as usual.

Bring on <em>'Fast XI'</em> or whatever they decide to call it. Apparently we're still getting another one after that, which I personally hope has its own sequel, which in turn has its sequel, followed by another seque... you get my point. I wanna be 105 and sat in the cinema watching another one of these.ðŸ˜‚

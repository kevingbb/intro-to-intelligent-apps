John Wick: Chapter 4 might be a little long, but when it is fun, there are few films that can compete with its magnetism. Reeves shows why he’s one of the best genre actors in the world and pours his heart and soul into a soft-spoken performance. Combined with Stahelski’s fight sequences, this is sure to become a highly rewatched, often quoted classic.

**John Wick: Chapter 4 is at the peak of action cinema and fight choreography. What the film lacks in story is dramatically overcome with the most stunning action set pieces ever seen.**

John Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick’s story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don’t go to a John Wick movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence.

Now this is an whole lot better than "John Wick - Paracetamol" (2019) but it is still not very good. This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful "Marquis" (Bill Skarsgård), who has managed to get those at the "High Table" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting "Winston" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the "Marquis" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for "Wick", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar®️ suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2½ hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsgård isn't remotely menacing - like a poor "James Bond" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting "thwack" and "pow" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same.

"John Wick: Chapter 4 concludes the game-changing saga with a relentless, ruthless action masterclass that ultimately justifies its epic length. The jaw-dropping stunts deserve the "some of the best ever" hyperbole, and the supporting cast holds brilliant additions - Donnie Yen and the dog are my MVPs. By far, the most visually striking film of all, boasting colorful cinematography that reflects the characters' spirits. Still, the importance of lighting and camera work in the spectacular action set pieces is truly impressive - THAT sequence shot from above is an all-timer. Original remains supreme, nonetheless."

John Wick: Chapter 4

Screenplay: John Wick movies didn't pay much attention to the script, except for the first movie. This movie gave more importance to the script than the last 2 movies. Since the duration is long, they have processed each character beautifully. The script isn't at the forefront, though.

Acting: Actors in the movie have already proven themselves. It was all very good.

Music: It was nice to hear the music from the old movies too. However, there was also new music. Every music was suitable for the stage and very good.

Action: Although there were exaggerated scenes about action, it was better than all the first 3 movies. In particular, there is an action scene shot from the top. That scene is one of the best I've ever seen in the cinema. You enjoy each scene of the action separately. You have trouble sitting in the chair.

Movie Duration: Even though the movie is long, you never notice it. It was a very moving movie.

Overall: This movie is definitely worth watching. It might be the best movie of the series.

Well it's not woke, and it's fun so... 10 stars, it achieved what it set out to do, entertain, and you can't ask for more than that.

Sure, in the 90s it would have been... well, stupid, action movies really stank in the 90s.  And in the 80s it would have had more of a plot and been a lot better...

... but in 2023 "Entertaining and politics free" makes a movie into a masterpiece.  

Its wall to wall action, with only about 3% dedicated to plot and the only really thinking it requires you to do is  wonder "if there are so many assassins in the world, how is it a lucrative profession?"

I don’t need to tell you that the violent action in “John Wick: Chapter 4” is over the top. If you’re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you’re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren’t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise’s highest body count in its wake.

After being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.

This is Reeves’ movie through and through, and he’s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It’s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsgård) breathes fresh life into the franchise.

The story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you’re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It’s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.

Director Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn’t a film with rapid cutting where you can’t tell what is going on, and it’s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski’s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.

Despite all of the things that are done right, the film’s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.

“John Wick: Chapter 4” is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It’s one rousing, wild ride.

John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.

One of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.

But perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.

One slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.

Overall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

Score: 93%
Verdict: Excellent

The John Wick franchise has now made it to its fourth and maybe final, film. The question is, is it any good?

Simply put, its "alright". In much the same way, as its 2019 predecessor, was alright. The script in this kind of exposition driven, action fare does not, typically, change that much. 

A certain amount of creativity and thought, has gone into the stylised, highly choreographed action and violence.

That said, after the first 30 or so minutes of unrelenting gun play/martial art, mash ups, it starts to feeling "saturating." 
 
I can see how the creators have tried to alleviate this feeling of repetition, by offering up differing locations, the use of exotic or special weapons but its simply, not enough. A more evolved story would have helped but regrettably, that was not on offer.

In summary, by no means a poor film but not quite as remarkable, in my estimation, as some reviews would suggest. Still, a decent weekend watch, with your mates over a bag or two of chips and a few beers.

**A beautiful woman doesn't mean a beautiful character**

Ninehundredmillion (nearly a **billion!** obviously guarantees beautiful pictures - but does that guarantee a profound movie? No!

Since _the Matrix_  Keanu Reeves was established as an action hero - yet he actually never delivered martial arts in a way professionals could relate to him in a way they can to Bruce Lee, Jason Stratham or Jackie Chan (who did perform their own stunts) could. 

Reeves - always somehow clumsy when fighting does kind of "stagger" through his shootings and the longer the movie goes on, the more disbelief has to be suspended (like when him shooting 46 shots with one round of 24 shots on the stairs up, where he conveniently kills 26 people). 

How many times he was run over I did not even bother to count, because it starts to become unbelievable by the third time.

Would you consider Reeves to be worth $39.000 for each single word like "yes" or "you" he uttered ? 
I don't, because it is not his charisma which saves the movie but the never-ending shooting scenes which in the end make you go to the toilet in the midst of a scene knowing that "_action is inaction and profound talks are rare here_".

Marquis Vincent de Gramont

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!! PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!

It's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone’s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.

I was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let’s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain’t just a chapter. It’s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I’m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I’ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.

First of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu’s most consistent and better performances, I would’ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn’t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston’s place as John’s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it’s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I’m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsgård** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn’t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn’t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsgård rises up as this franchise’s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table’s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would’ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.

Now, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn’t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn’t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it’s a huge summer blockbuster).

Where do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I’ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn’t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you’ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn’t skip a beat.

The Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn’t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar. A perfect end to a perfect film.

Go watch this film, you will not be disappointed.

Far better than Chapter 3, but then it really couldn't be any worse, but still a far cry from Chapters 1 and 2. And why Donnie Yen agreed to play the same role he played in Rogue One is beyond me.

Solid entry in the franchise with some great fight choreography which is to be expected at this point and while the story is thin and does clock in at 169 minutes, still found it entertaining and a fine conclusion. **4.0/5**

# Using the OpenAI Library

In the [first](../01-AzureOpenAIAPI/azureopenaiapi.md) lab, we showed how to use the Azure OpenAI API directly. In this lab we'll show how to interact with the Azure OpenAI API using the OpenAI Python library. This will provide some insight into the configuration and setup that is needed to use one of these higher level abstraction frameworks.

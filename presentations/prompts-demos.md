# Prompts

In this document you will find demos for the "Intro to Azure OpenAI, Prompt Engineering & Demos" morning session. The demos are aimed at showing how certain prompts can be made better by following recommended prompt engineering practices.

**All of these demos can be done using Azure AI Studio.**

## :muscle: Demo 1 - Separate instruction and context

* Good:

```text
Summarize the text below as a bullet point list of the most important points.

We’re happy to announce that OpenAI and Microsoft are extending our partnership. This multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft follows their previous investments in 2019 and 2021, and will allow us to continue our independent research and develop AI that is increasingly safe, useful, and powerful.

In pursuit of our mission to ensure advanced AI benefits all of humanity, OpenAI remains a capped-profit company and is governed by the OpenAI non-profit. This structure allows us to raise the capital we need to fulfill our mission without sacrificing our core beliefs about broadly sharing benefits and the need to prioritize safety. Microsoft shares this vision and our values, and our partnership is instrumental to our progress.
